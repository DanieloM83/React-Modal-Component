# React Modal Component

**Pretty and easy-to-use modal window** implemented via **react**. You can freely use the code in your projects.

The repository has **an example of using a modal.** There is a separate **custom hook** called `UseModal` for this. The `Portal` built-in react is also used, which redirects the modal to the `root-modals`.

## Get Started

To try out the project **(along with a test login form)** run the following commands in the terminal:

```bash
git clone -b javascript https://github.com/DanieloM83/React-Modal-Component.git

cd React-Modal-Component

npm install -g yarn  # npm comes bundled with Node.js

yarn  # download all dependencies (may take some time)

yarn dev  # start the project
```

This will launch the project on your local machine, and you can access it by navigating to (usually) http://localhost:5173 in your web browser.
